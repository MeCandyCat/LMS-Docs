This is a small neat feature that allows you to quickly grab the usernames of everyone who is currently in the meeting.

**Use the command `/attendance` without any options to mark the vc you are in**\

**Or you can mention a different voice channel in optional parameters**\

An embed with marked attendance will be sent to the channel where the command was executed.\
